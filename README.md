# MASC: Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Scheduling Chain for Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the **Multi-Agent Scheduling Chain (MASC)**, a framework leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems** to solve the **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP)**. MASC integrates LLM-driven decision-making with a structured **multi-agent** approach to enhance scheduling efficiency, adaptability, and automation in dynamic manufacturing environments.

This repository includes:
- The **SchedAgent** implementation based on **LLMs fine-tuned with QLoRA**.
- The **DialBag method**, which enhances knowledge retention in LLM-based scheduling.
- Simulation and real-world **robotic arm experiments** validating MASCâ€™s performance.
- Preprocessed **datasets** and **experimental results** for reproducibility.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Agents for observation, scheduling, planning, and control.
- **LLM-Driven Decision Making:** Enhanced scheduling through LLM-powered **SchedAgent**.
- **Flexible Scheduling Capabilities:** Supports both **simulated** and **real-world** execution.
- **Knowledge Retention via DialBag:** Improves scheduling efficiency without forgetting previous knowledge.

---

## Requirements
- **Python >= 3.8**
- **PyTorch >= 1.12.0 (2.0.0 and above are recommended)**
- **Transformers >= 4.38**

---


## Reproducibility
To ensure reproducibility, we provide:
- **Preprocessed scheduling datasets**
- **Fine-tuned LLM model weights**
- **Simulation & real-world scheduling experiment logs**

For any inconsistencies, please open an issue.

## Results & Benchmarks
Our experimental results demonstrate:
| Method                | ARC (%) | HellaSwag (%) | MMLU (%) | SchedQA (%) |
|----------------------|---------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| internlm2-7b        | 83.73   | 85.64        | **62.19** | 31.36       |
| internlm2-7b + Single Round | 72.2    | 81.01        | 61.01     | 31.47       |
| **internlm2-7b + DialBag** | **84.75** | **86.14** | 58.93     | **32.11**   |

These results validate that **DialBag effectively reduces knowledge forgetting** while improving **domain-specific scheduling accuracy**.
